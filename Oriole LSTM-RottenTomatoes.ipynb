    "In the pre-deep learning era, NLP was a thriving field that saw lots of different advancements. However, in all of the successes in the aforementioned tasks, one needed to do a lot of feature enginering and thus had to have a lot of domain knowledge in linguistics. Entire 4 year degrees are devoted to this field of study, as practitioners needed to be comfortable with terms like phonemes and morphemes. In the past few years, deep learning has seen incredible progress and has largely removed the requirement of strong domain knowledge. As a result of the lower barrier to entry, applications to NLP tasks have been one of the biggest areas of deep learning research. "

Without going into too much detail, the model creates word vectors by looking at the context with which words appear in sentences. Words with similar contexts will be placed close together in the vector space. In natural language, the context of words can be very important when trying to determine their meanings. Taking our previous example of the words \"adore\" and \"love\", consider the types of sentences we'd find these words in.\n",

This is an indication that both words have something in common and can possibly be synonyms. Context is also very important when considering grammatical structure in sentences. Most sentences will follow traditional paradigms of having verbs follow nouns, adjectives precede nouns, and so on. For this reason, the model is more likely to position nouns in the same general area as other nouns. The model takes in a large dataset of sentences (English Wikipedia for example) and outputs vectors for each unique word in the corpus. The output of a Word2Vec model is called an embedding matrix.\n",

Using a loss function and optimization procedure, the model generates vectors for each unique word. The specifics of this training procedure can get a little complicated, so we’re going to skip over the details for now, but the main takeaway here is that inputs into any Deep Learning approach to an NLP task will likely have word vectors as input.\n",

Each word in a sentence depends greatly on what came before and comes after it. In order to account for this dependency, we use a recurrent neural network.  \n",

If you take a close look at the superscripts, you’ll see that there’s a weight matrix W<sup>X</sup> which we’re going to multiply with our input, and there’s a recurrent weight matrix W<sup>H</sup> which is multiplied with the hidden state vector at the previous time step. W<sup>H</sup> is a matrix that stays the same across all time steps, and the weight matrix W<sup>X</sup> is different for each input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of these weight matrices impact the amount the hidden state vector is affected by either the current vector or the previous hidden state. As an exercise, take a look at the above formula, and consider how h<sub>t</sub> would change if either W<sup>X</sup> or W<sup>H</sup> had large or small values. \n",

    "Let's look at a quick example. When the magnitude of W<sup>H</sup> is large and the magnitude of W<sup>X</sup> is small, we know that h<sub>t</sub> is largely affected by h<sub>t-1</sub> and unaffected by x<sub>t</sub>. In other words, the current hidden state vector sees that the current word is largely inconsequential to the overall summary of the sentence, and thus it will take on mostly the same value as the vector at the previous time step. \n",

As we saw in the previous section, the formulation for h in traditional RNNs is relatively simple. This approach won't be able to effectively connect together information that is separated by more than a couple time steps. We can illiustrate this idea of handling long term dependencies through an example in the field of question answering. The function of question answering models is to take an a passage of text, and answer a question about its content. Let's look at the following example.\n",

With a classic RNN, the hidden state vector at the end of the network might have stored more information about the dog sentence than about the first sentence about the number. Basically, the addition of LSTM units make it possible to determine the correct and useful information that needs to be stored in the hidden state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at LSTM units from a more technical viewpoint, the units take in the current word vector x<sub>t</sub> and output the hidden state vector h<sub>t</sub>. In these units, the formulation for h<sub>t</sub> will be a bit more complex than that in a typical RNN.

Each intermediate state gets fed into different pipelines and eventually the information is aggregated to form h<sub>t</sub>. For simplicity sake, we won't go into the specific formulations for each gate, but it's worth noting that each of these gates can be thought of as different modules within the LSTM that each have different functions. The input gate determines how much emphasis to put on each of the inputs, the forget gate determines the information that we'll throw away, and the output gate determines the final h<sub>t</sub> based on the intermediate states. For more information on understanding the functions of the different gates and the full equations, check out Christopher Olah's great [blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",

    "Looking back at the first example with question “What is the sum of the two numbers?”, the model would have to be trained on similar types of questions and answers. The LSTM units would then be able to realize that any sentence without numbers will likely not have an impact on the answer to the question, and thus the unit will be able to utilize its forget gate to discard the unnecessary information about the dog, and rather keep the information regarding the numbers.

    "Now that we have our vectors, our first step is taking an input sentence and then constructing the its vector representation. Let's say that we have the input sentence \"I thought the movie was incredible and inspiring\". In order to get the word vectors, we can use Tensorflow's embedding lookup function. This function takes in two arguments, one for the embedding matrix (the wordVectors matrix in our case), and one for the ids of each of the words. The ids vector can be thought of as the integerized representation of the training set. This is basically just the row index of each of the words. Let's look at a quick example to make this concrete.

This is where the final hidden state vector of the first LSTM feeds into the second. Stacking these cells is a great way to help the model retain more long term dependence information, but also introduces more parameters into the model, thus possibly increasing the training time, the need for additional training examples, and the chance of overfitting.

    "Choosing the right values for your hyperparameters is a crucial part of training deep neural networks effectively. You'll find that your training loss curves can vary with your choice of optimizer (Adam, Adadelta, SGD, etc), learning rate, and network architecture. With RNNs and LSTMs in particular, some other important factors include the number of LSTM units and the size of the word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning Rate: RNNs are infamous for being diffult to train because of the large number of time steps they have. Learning rate becomes extremely important since we don't want our weight values to fluctuate wildly as a result of a large learning rate, nor do we want a slow training process due to a low learning rate. The default value of 0.001 is a good place to start. You should increase this value if the training loss is changing very slowly, and decrease if the loss is unstable.  \n",
    "* Optimizer: There isn't a consensus choice among researchers, but Adam has been widely popular due to having the adaptive learning rate property (Keep in mind that optimal learning rates can differ with the choice of optimizer).\n",
    "* Number of LSTM units: This value is largely dependent on the average length of your input texts. While a greater number of units provides more expressibility for the model and allows the model to store more information for longer texts, the network will take longer to train and will be computationally expensive. \n",
    "* Word Vector Size: Dimensions for word vectors generally range from 50 to 300. A larger size means that the vector is able to encapsulate more information about the word, but you should also expect a more computationally expensive model. "

    "Looking at the training curves above, it seems that the model's training is going well. The loss is decreasing steadily, and the accuracy is approaching 100 percent. However, when analyzing training curves, we should also pay special attention to the possibility of our model overfitting the training dataset. Overfitting is a common phenomenon in machine learning where a model becomes so fit to the training data that it loses the ability to generalize to the test set. This means that training a network until you achieve 0 training loss might not be the best way to get an accurate model that performs well on data it has never seen before. Early stopping is an intuitive technique commonly used with LSTM networks to combat this issue. The basic idea is that we train the model on our training set, while also measuring its performance on the test set every now and again. Once the test error stops its steady decrease and begins to increase instead, you'll know to stop training, since this is a sign that the network has begun to overfit. "

We looked at the different components involved in the whole pipeline and then looked at the process of writing Tensorflow code to implement the model in practice. Finally, we trained and tested the model so that it is able to classify movie reviews.\n",
