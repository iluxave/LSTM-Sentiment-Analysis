    "In the pre-deep learning era, NLP was a thriving field that saw lots of different advancements. However, in all of the successes in the aforementioned tasks, one needed to do a lot of feature enginering and thus had to have a lot of domain knowledge in linguistics. Entire 4 year degrees are devoted to this field of study, as practitioners needed to be comfortable with terms like phonemes and morphemes. In the past few years, deep learning has seen incredible progress and has largely removed the requirement of strong domain knowledge. As a result of the lower barrier to entry, applications to NLP tasks have been one of the biggest areas of deep learning research. "

Words with similar contexts will be placed close together in the vector space. In natural language, the context of words can be very important when trying to determine their meanings.

This is an indication that both words have something in common and can possibly be synonyms. Context is also very important when considering grammatical structure in sentences. Most sentences will follow traditional paradigms of having verbs follow nouns, adjectives precede nouns, and so on. For this reason, the model is more likely to position nouns in the same general area as other nouns. The model takes in a large dataset of sentences (English Wikipedia for example) and outputs vectors for each unique word in the corpus.

The specifics of this training procedure can get a little complicated, so we’re going to skip over the details for now, but the main takeaway here is that inputs into any Deep Learning approach to an NLP task will likely have word vectors as input.\n",

W<sup>H</sup> is a matrix that stays the same across all time steps, and the weight matrix W<sup>X</sup> is different for each input. \n",

When the magnitude of W<sup>H</sup> is large and the magnitude of W<sup>X</sup> is small, we know that h<sub>t</sub> is largely affected by h<sub>t-1</sub> and unaffected by x<sub>t</sub>.

As we saw in the previous section, the formulation for h in traditional RNNs is relatively simple. This approach won't be able to effectively connect together information that is separated by more than a couple time steps. We can illiustrate this idea of handling long term dependencies through an example in the field of question answering.

Basically, the addition of LSTM units make it possible to determine the correct and useful information that needs to be stored in the hidden state vector.\n",

    "Looking at LSTM units from a more technical viewpoint, the units take in the current word vector x<sub>t</sub> and output the hidden state vector h<sub>t</sub>.

Each intermediate state gets fed into different pipelines and eventually the information is aggregated to form h<sub>t</sub>. For simplicity sake, we won't go into the specific formulations for each gate, but it's worth noting that each of these gates can be thought of as different modules within the LSTM that each have different functions. The input gate determines how much emphasis to put on each of the inputs, the forget gate determines the information that we'll throw away, and the output gate determines the final h<sub>t</sub> based on the intermediate states.

The LSTM units would then be able to realize that any sentence without numbers will likely not have an impact on the answer to the question, and thus the unit will be able to utilize its forget gate to discard the unnecessary information about the dog, and rather keep the information regarding the numbers.

    "Choosing the right values for your hyperparameters is a crucial part of training deep neural networks effectively. You'll find that your training loss curves can vary with your choice of optimizer (Adam, Adadelta, SGD, etc), learning rate, and network architecture. With RNNs and LSTMs in particular, some other important factors include the number of LSTM units and the size of the word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning Rate: RNNs are infamous for being diffult to train because of the large number of time steps they have. Learning rate becomes extremely important since we don't want our weight values to fluctuate wildly as a result of a large learning rate, nor do we want a slow training process due to a low learning rate. The default value of 0.001 is a good place to start. You should increase this value if the training loss is changing very slowly, and decrease if the loss is unstable.  \n",
    "* Optimizer: There isn't a consensus choice among researchers, but Adam has been widely popular due to having the adaptive learning rate property (Keep in mind that optimal learning rates can differ with the choice of optimizer).\n",
    "* Number of LSTM units: This value is largely dependent on the average length of your input texts. While a greater number of units provides more expressibility for the model and allows the model to store more information for longer texts, the network will take longer to train and will be computationally expensive. \n",
    "* Word Vector Size: Dimensions for word vectors generally range from 50 to 300. A larger size means that the vector is able to encapsulate more information about the word, but you should also expect a more computationally expensive model. "

    "Looking at the training curves above, it seems that the model's training is going well. The loss is decreasing steadily, and the accuracy is approaching 100 percent. However, when analyzing training curves, we should also pay special attention to the possibility of our model overfitting the training dataset. Overfitting is a common phenomenon in machine learning where a model becomes so fit to the training data that it loses the ability to generalize to the test set. This means that training a network until you achieve 0 training loss might not be the best way to get an accurate model that performs well on data it has never seen before. Early stopping is an intuitive technique commonly used with LSTM networks to combat this issue. The basic idea is that we train the model on our training set, while also measuring its performance on the test set every now and again. Once the test error stops its steady decrease and begins to increase instead, you'll know to stop training, since this is a sign that the network has begun to overfit. "

We looked at the different components involved in the whole pipeline and then looked at the process of writing Tensorflow code to implement the model in practice. Finally, we trained and tested the model so that it is able to classify movie reviews.\n",
